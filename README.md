# Future Enhancements:
Looking forward, we plan to enhance IntelliGrade by incorporating additional AI models to improve the accuracy of grading and expanding its capabilities to support a wider range of educational materials. We also aim to develop a user-friendly interface that allows educators to easily input data and receive grading results.

IntelliGrade represents a significant step forward in automating the grading process, offering a solution that is not only efficient but also promising in terms of accuracy and reliability. The integration of the few-shot learning technique with Turbo-GPT-3.5 is a testament to the potential of AI in education, showcasing how technology can transform the way we assess and learn.
