       "'Question 1 [5]:\\nWhat is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\\nAnswer1: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes code into\\nobjects, which are instances of classes. It emphasizes the concept of \"objects\" that encapsulate data\\nand behavior. OOP principles include encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, providing a\\nmodular and organized approach to software development.\\nQuestion 2 [5]:\\nExplain Encapsulation in OOP.\\nAnswer2: Encapsulation is the OOP principle that involves bundling data (attributes) and methods\\n(functions) that operate on the data into a single unit known as an object. It helps in hiding the\\ninternal details of an object and restricting direct access to its implementation. Encapsulation\\nenhances code organization, reduces complexity, and promotes data integrity by controlling access to\\nthe internal state of objects.\\nQuestion 3 [2]:\\nWhat is Inheritance in OOP?\\nAnswer3: Inheritance is a fundamental OOP concept that allows a new class (subclass or derived\\nclass) to inherit attributes and behaviors from an existing class (superclass or base class). This\\npromotes code reusability and establishes a hierarchy of classes. The subclass can extend or override\\nthe functionality of the superclass while inheriting its characteristics.\\nQuestion 4 [2]:\\nDescribe the concept of Polymorphism in OOP.\\nAnswer4: Polymorphism in OOP refers to the ability of objects to take on multiple forms or the ability\\nof a method to perform different actions based on the object it is acting upon. This can be achieved\\nthrough method overloading (same method name, different parameters) and method overriding\\n(same method name and parameters, different implementation). Polymorphism enhances flexibility\\nand adaptability in code design.\\nQuestion 5 [2]:\\nWhat is Abstraction in the context of Object-Oriented Programming?\\nAnswer5: Abstraction is the process of simplifying complex systems by modeling classes based on the\\nessential properties and behaviors relevant to the problem at hand, while ignoring unnecessary\\ndetails. It involves creating abstract classes or interfaces that define a common structure without\\nspecifying the implementation. Abstraction helps in managing complexity, improving code\\nreadability, and facilitating code maintenance.'"
